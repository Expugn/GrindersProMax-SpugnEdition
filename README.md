# GrindersProMax - S'pugn Edition
Original Script: https://github.com/KritixKaung/PSO2-GrindersProMax/blob/master/readme.md

## Information
This is a modified version of PSO2-GrindersProMax.
This is designed for the GLOBAL version of Phantasy Star Online 2, the Japan version may or may not be compatible with this.

The differences between the original and this script is that it features a different buying route and an EX-Cube counter is included.

## Regarding ALT-TABing
It is best to bring this program to foreground with F1 to perform tasks while you're in the game instead of alt tabbing because alt tabbing 
might mess up with selections in the game. ***It is important that you don't input anything into the game while the script is running.***

## Script Timing
The original script is created for 144fps+ and around 100ping to server but has since been tweaked for a different setup.
If your performance has a huge difference from this the script might not perform as intended for you. 
Try increasing sleep timers in `50ms` increments.

## How To Use:
**MAKE SURE TO RUN THIS SCRIPT AS ADMINISTRATOR**. Inputs may not work otherwise.
### Buying Process
1. Make sure your Inventory and Material Storage are empty of Grinders.
	- This is to ensure you can buy as much Grinders as possible.
	- Material Storage has an item limit of 65,000 so existing Grinders may cause issues if purchasing the max.
2. Talk to Nyssa the EX-Cube NPC and open up the SHOP MENU.
3. Review the GUI and set your desired targeted Meseta if needed.
	- Leaving the desired Meseta count as 0 will cause the script to purchase as much Grinders as possible.
4. While "EX-Cube Exchange Shop" is hovered, click the "Start Buying" button.
5. While the script is running...
	- You can also see the amount of grinders you have bought and meseta amount of it in the 
	  GUI so if you're only buying for a small amount of money you can end the buying process sooner by clicking "Stop Buying" button.

### Selling Process
1. Go to any NPC where you can sell items 
2. Select "Sell Items from Storage"
3. Open your Material Storage
4. Input "Grinder" in the search bar and Search
5. Make sure you have selected Grinders and click the "Start Selling" button.
